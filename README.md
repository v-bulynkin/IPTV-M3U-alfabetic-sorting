# IPTV .m3u alfabetic sorting
When .m3u is not sorted by name it's hard to find the channel you need. This script fixes it.

## How it works
It asks you to enter a URL of a playlist like https://site.com/playlist.m3u. Then the playlist is downloaded to "Downloads" folder in your profile and processed.
After work is done, the playlist is ready to use.
